I am currently a fifth-year Ph.D.student at MIT at the Institute for Data, Systems, and Society. My research is focused on fair decision-making, models of structural/systemic injustice, and the dynamics of inequality, particularly focusing on the racial wealth gap. I am also interested in algorithmic fairness and mechanism design for social good. Primarily I use agent-based simulation and economic models to investigate the long-term distributive outcomes of public policy. 

I am advised by Prof. Peko Hosoi and am also in Prof. Catherine D'Ignazio's lab. 

Prior to MIT, I received my Bachelor's degree from Pomona College in mathematics in 2019. I also spent a summer as a research assistant at North Carolina State, advised by Dr. Min Chi.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.test

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below.
